### 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

Hey there! I'm **Mohamed Hassan** 👋

A **Full-Stack .NET Developer** from **Cairo, Egypt** 🇪🇬 who's obsessed with writing **clean, scalable code** and building systems that actually work!

I graduated as a **Mechatronics Engineer** but found my true calling in **software development**. My graduation project? A freaking **Self-Driving Car** 🚗 — yes, I made a car drive itself!

I've trained **100+ students** in programming, built **100+ API endpoints**, and somehow managed to keep my code under **200ms response time**. Not bad, right? 😎
