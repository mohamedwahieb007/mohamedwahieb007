## 🧑‍💻 About Me

<img align="right" alt="Coding" width="400" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74038190/229223263-cf2e4b07-2615-4f87-9c38-e37600f8381a.gif">

I'm **Mohamed Hassan**, a passionate **Full-Stack .NET Developer** based in **Cairo, Egypt** 🇪🇬

I graduated from **Fayoum University** with a **B.Sc. in Mechatronics Engineering** (GPA: 3.33/4.0), where I built a **Self-Driving Car** 🚗 as my graduation project and received an **Excellent** grade.

My journey into software development began with a love for solving complex problems and building systems that make a real impact. I specialize in the **Microsoft .NET ecosystem**, crafting clean, scalable, and maintainable backend systems using **C#**, **ASP.NET Core**, and **Entity Framework Core**.

I'm a firm believer in **Clean Architecture**, **SOLID principles**, and writing code that not only works but is also a pleasure to maintain. I've had the privilege of training **100+ students** in programming fundamentals, which has strengthened my ability to communicate complex technical concepts clearly.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or diving into system design concepts. I'm currently expanding my skills in **Microservices**, **Docker**, and **Cloud Technologies**.

### 🎯 Quick Highlights:
- 🔭 Currently building **KORIEK** - Automotive Service Marketplace with **100+ API endpoints**
- 👨‍🏫 Trained **100+ students** with **85% satisfaction rate**
- 🚀 Achieved **<200ms response times** serving **50+ concurrent users**
- 🤖 Integrated **OpenAI GPT** for AI-powered chatbot functionality
- 🌍 **IELTS 7.5** - Professional English Proficiency
- 💡 Fun fact: My graduation project was a **Self-Driving Car!** 🚗
